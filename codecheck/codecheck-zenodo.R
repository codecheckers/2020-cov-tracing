require(codecheck)

metadata = read_yaml( "../codecheck.yml") 

## To interact with the Zenodo API, you need to create a token.  This should
## not be shared, or stored in this script.  Here I am using the Unix password

my_token = system("pass show codechecker-token", intern=TRUE)

## make a connection to Zenodo API
zenodo <- ZenodoManager$new(token = my_token)


## If you wish to create a new record on zenodo, run the following line once
## and then store the URL of the record in  ../codecheck.yml
## This will generate a new record every time that you run it.
## record = create_zenodo_record(zenodo)

## delete it via the web page before uploading it again.
## set_zenodo_certificate(zenodo, record, "codecheck.pdf") 

## Now go to zenodo and check the record (the URL for the deposit is
